                            <p>Palawan’s best-known spots are El Nido and Coron with their spectacular dive sites, but there are also more off-the-beaten-track locations such as Port Barton, Taytay, Roxas, Brooke’s Point and San Vicente to discover, with their promise of authentic food and local experiences including wildlife sanctuary visits.

                                Meanwhile, the capital Puerto Princesa City is a great place to soak up some history at the Immaculate Conception Cathedral and WWI site Plaza Cuartel, as well as to shop and eat.</p>

                <h1>Why is it more fun in PALAWAN</h1>
                <br>
                <p>With its beaches, lakes, waterfalls, mineral springs, rivers and creeks, Palawan is a place where activities in the great outdoors take on a new and magical dimension. Diving is a big deal here – expect to see spotted manta rays, green sea turtles and nocturnal marine creatures including seahorses, shrimp and cat sharks. Meanwhile, waterfall-swimming and hiking, jungle trekking and cave boat-trips are among the array of other stand-out pursuits on offer. And don’t miss birdwatching at some of country’s best sites, where migratory birds are joined by 15 species endemic to this province.</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h1>Food and Culture</h1>
                <br>
                <p>With a history beginning with prehistoric settlement (seen in the ancient tribal artworks of the Tabon Caves) and proceeding through Malaysian migration, Spanish colonisation, American rule and Japanese invasion, Palawan is much more than its blissful white-sand beaches and incredible natural resources. This is also a province where around 70 cultures live together in harmony, with different languages and dialects (more than 50), beliefs, festivals, art forms and tribes. The best places to get a handle on this heterogeneity are the National Museum and Palawan Museum in Puerto Princesa.

                    Palawan also has a rich food culture into which all these influences have fed. Among local treats to seek out and sample are superfresh seafood including tamilok (a shell-less saltwater clam, served ceviche-style or fried), crocodile sisig (a sizzling minced-meat dish), lato seaweed salad, hopia bread (a sweet flaky pastry best eaten at Baker’s Hill in Puerto Princesa), danggit lamayo (dried rabbitfish) and chao long (Vietnamese-inspired noodles). Foodies should also make a beeline for San Jose Market in Puerto Princesa.</p>

                            <p>There are various ethnolinguistic groups that consider Palawan as home. These are the Tagbanua, Palaw’an, Tau’t bato and the Bataks. The mountains and coastal areas serve as their homes. These groups have built villages in those areas and have been staying there for quite some time already</p>

                <p>Waves of migrants from other Philippine provinces, and even other countries, have turned Puerto Princesa into a melting pot of various cultures. Among the original inhabitants are the Cuyunons who posses a rich legacy of folklores and traditions. Indigenous groups include the Tagbanuas and the Bataks, each group with its distinct culture and system of beliefs.

                    Total inhabitants number about 210,508 (as of 2007), Three fourth of the population resides in the city proper, an urban settlement on the shores of Puerto Princesa Bay. While the predominant local tongue is Cuyuno, Tagalog, Visayan, as well as English are widely spoken.
                    
                    Puerto Princesa is a melting pot of people with different cultures. This is attributed to the influx of migrants from other Philippine provinces. One of the reasons for the city's high annual growth rate at 6.6 percent. The predominant local tongue is Cuyuno. However, other languages like English and Tagalog, and dialects such as Bicolano, Cebuano, Hilgaynon, Ilocano are widely spoken.</p>
